# Function Overloading in C++

This code demonstrates the concept of function overloading in C++. 
Function overloading allows us to define multiple functions with the same name, but with different parameters. 
This can be useful when we want to perform the same operation on different data types, or when we want to provide different implementations of the same operation for different scenarios.

In this example, we have defined multiple versions of the `sum()` function. 
The first four versions take two arguments, one integer and one double, and return a double. 
The next eight versions take three arguments, two integers and one double, and return a double. 
The last four versions take four arguments, two integers and two doubles, and return a double.

In the `main()` function, we call the `sum()` function with various combinations of integer and double arguments. 
The output shows that the correct version of the `sum()` function is called each time, depending on the types of the arguments.

## Step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. We include the `<iostream>` header file, which contains the `cout` object that we use to print output to the console.
2. We define the `sum()` function with two integer arguments, and return the sum of the two arguments.
3. We define the `sum()` function with two double arguments, and return the sum of the two arguments.
4. We define the `sum()` function with one double argument and one integer argument, and return the sum of the two arguments.
5. We define the `sum()` function with one integer argument and one double argument, and return the sum of the two arguments.
6. We define the `sum()` function with three integer arguments, and return the sum of the three arguments.
7. We define the `sum()` function with two integer arguments and one double argument, and return the sum of the three arguments.
8. We define the `sum()` function with one integer argument and two double arguments, and return the sum of the three arguments.
9. We define the `sum()` function with three double arguments, and return the sum of the three arguments.
10. We define the `sum()` function with two double arguments and one integer argument, and return the sum of the three arguments.
11. We define the `sum()` function with one double argument and two integer arguments, and return the sum of the
