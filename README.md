# Functions

1) Functions
   This code demonstrates the concept of function overloading in C++. 
Function overloading allows us to define multiple functions with the same name, but with different parameters. 
This can be useful when we want to perform the same operation on different data types, or when we want to provide different implementations of the same operation for different scenarios.

In this example, we have defined multiple versions of the `sum()` function. 
The first four versions take two arguments, one integer and one double, and return a double. 
The next eight versions take three arguments, two integers and one double, and return a double. 
The last four versions take four arguments, two integers and two doubles, and return a double.

In the `main()` function, we call the `sum()` function with various combinations of integer and double arguments. 
The output shows that the correct version of the `sum()` function is called each time, depending on the types of the arguments.
